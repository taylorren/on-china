# CCP

CCP, or Chinese Communist Party was established on 1921 by the inspirations from two sources: one is the Russia Revolution in 1921; one is the propaganda by several pioneers of Marxism.

From the very moment of its establishment, CCP was heavily influenced and commanded by      Communist International (Comintern), which in turn, was controlled by then Soviet Union.

China, being halfly-colonized by Western powers, had gone through its darkest period from 1949. 

Those "knowledgeables" got acquainted with varius theories, most of which came from the Western world. 

We are not to discuss the details in Marxism as this has already been covered by so many books. 

At least two questions puzzle me. One, how a party (like CCP) can gather such a level of loyalty from its members (especially before 1949)? The other, how the legitimacy of government of CCP was established?

To make someone "loyal", there may be two main ways: one is by offering benefits or promise of future benefits; the other is through intimidation and deprivation of alternatives. 

In the early stage, CCP has not gained power enough to allocate social resources as "benefits" and the future of CCP was dim. 

This approach is still widely used today, while the purpose is less on retainting loyalty than on containing deviations.

## 投名状 (Tou Ming Zhuang, Manifestation of Allegiance)

TMZ is a common act when someone tried to join a gang/"illegal group", he/she had to do something to prove that the purpose of his/her request was genuine. Normally, the gang master will ask him to kill one person (so that his hand is blooded). By committing a homocide (or other similar unforgivable crimes), there will be no good for this guy to turn back on the gang later. Thus, "loyalty" is proved and maintained. 

But is this to be called loyalty? Or is it just a subjection out of fear and intimidation? I believe so. 

My logic goes like this： he has no where to go;
