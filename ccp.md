# CCP

CCP, or Chinese Communist Party was established on 1921 by the inspirations from two sources: one is the Russia Revolution in 1921; one is the propaganda by several pioneers of Marxism.

From the very moment of its establishment, CCP was heavily influenced and commanded by      Communist International (Comintern), which in turn, was controlled by then Soviet Union.

China, being halfly-colonized by Western powers, had gone through its darkest period from 1949. 

Those "knowledgeables" got acquainted with varius theories, most of which came from the Western world. 

We are not to discuss the details in Marxism as this has already been covered by so many books. 

At least two questions puzzle me.
