This is a book written in English and stored in GitHub. 

Due to the sensitivity of the contents, I have to make the above arrangement. 

In 2018, China has gone through THE most shameful event in history: the constitution was modified so that the Chairman of PRC can in theory (and sure in practice) stay in the position as long as he/she wishes. 

The domestic media was once again in sync, not only in advocating this approach with articles from various theorists, but also banning all voices that may look against this approach.

On March 11th, 2018, the "proposed" modification stimulated by CCP was unanimously approved by NPC (National Peoples Congress). 

This is no surprise.

I am an ordinary man. When I sense something not right, I want to speak out; when I know I don't have a proper place to make my voice heard, I have to choose a platform that is still available. 

I don't know if I can finish this book, but I will do my best and whenever I have got something in mind, I will come and do some writing, commit them, and push them.
